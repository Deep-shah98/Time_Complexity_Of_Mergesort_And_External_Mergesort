# Time_Complexity_Of_Mergesort_And_External_Mergesort
Here i attached Merge Sort and External Merge Sort code and in pdf file attach their time complexity on different input like 1,10,100,1000,10000,20000,40000,50000,80000 and 100000 also attached their graph on a different input and compare these graph on the basis of best case, average case and worst case.
